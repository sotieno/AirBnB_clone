# Project Overview

![Hbnb_Logo](images/hbnb_logo.jpg)

This is a project aimed at building a clone of the AirBnB website. It will collectively cover fundamental concepts of higher level programming and at the end of the project the complete web application will be composed of:

* A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface like in a Shell
* A website (the front-end) that shows the final product to everyone: static and dynamic
* A database or files that store data (data = objects)
* An API that provides a communication interface between the front-end and your data (retrieve, create, delete, update them)
